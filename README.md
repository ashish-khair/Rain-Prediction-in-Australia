# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia
* Preprocessed the dataset, classified the Categorical and Numerical features, and handled the missing data.
* Used some techniques to remove the outliers.
* Encoded the Categorical Features and performed the Feature scaling on the training dataset.
* Used the Logistic Regression algorithm to train the model and obtained an accuracy score of 84%. The model does a very good job of predicting.
* The model shows no sign of Underfitting or Overfitting. This means the model generalizing well for unseen data.
* The mean accuracy score of cross-validation is almost the same as the original model accuracy score. So, the accuracy of the model may not be improved using Cross-validation
